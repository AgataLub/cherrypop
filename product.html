                        without judgement! It is important for us that young people have a place to look for this
                        information so they donâ€™t look to porn or other unreliable sources for guidance.</p>

                        shape and size. . We want people to feel safe and secure in their sexuality and be able to
                        express themselves however they desire without discrimination. We want to play a part in moving

                    <p>Cherry Pop concentrates on lack of information resulting in unwanted pregnancies, sexually
                        transmitted diseases, low self esteem and more. We are here to make a change and start an open
                        conversation about sex and everything that comes with it. We want to avoid embarrassing
                        discussions between teachers, parents and students.</p>
